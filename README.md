# FreeCodeCamp Tribute Page Project - Tim Berners-Lee

## What is this?
This static webpage was built to fulfill the requirements of the first freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design project: [Build a Tribute Page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page). This page - a short timeline of the life of the World Wide Web's creator, Sir Tim Berners-Lee - is designed to showcase basic responsive web design in plain HTML and CSS.

This project is hosted live on the web [here](https://timbt.github.io/fcc-tribute-page/) through Github pages.

## How Can I Run the Test Suite?
FreeCodeCamp provides a series of test suites which can be run in-browser to test a project against it's primary User Story requirements. The freeCodeCamp test suite script - which provides an interactive GUI for running the tests - is commented out in `index.html` for publishing to gh-pages. Uncomment it to enable the test suites.
